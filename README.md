=================================

A webapp to share what you see with your magicProxy with others.


# Intro

Your magicProxy will let you change a lot of things in how you view the internet, right? When it's time to show that to a client or a co-worker, you need to have them sit next to your computer, or connect to your proxy (and expose services that shouldn't be public, since the proxy will resolve stuff inside your private network)? No way!

letmeshowyoutheworldthroughmyeyes is still not ready, but it will allow you to share a link of what you see through your magicProxy, and to limit that link to a single FQDN (x.y.local) in your local network, computer (or in the internet), but still allow them to freely navigate in that realm.
